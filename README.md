Jscii
=====
Jscii is an image/stream to ASCII conversion library. It can convert a single image to ASCII characters using [HTML5 canvas](http://caniuse.com/canvas) 2d context to analyze the pixel data. It can also convert a video stream using the [getUserMedia API](http://caniuse.com/stream).

### Fork ###

Created an angular based UI for the engine and added the ability to convert images by simply providing a URL. Omitted video streaming etc. Also capable of resizing images since sometimes the text is unnecessarily big and added editing functionality.
